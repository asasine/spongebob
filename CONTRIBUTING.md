# Contributing
Thank you for taking an interest in this project! Following these guidelines helps me address your issues and changes.

This project is open to contributions from everyone, not just code. Reporting bugs, suggesting features, improving documentation, and writing code are all valuable contributions; I appreciate them all equally.

## Getting Started
Please ask before putting significant time into a new feature or bug fix. This project is a hobby, and I may already be working on something similar. If you have a new idea, I would love to hear about it!

Create a new issue if one doesn't already exist and I'll respond as soon as I can. If you're interested in working on an issue, please leave a comment so I can assign it to you.

## Pull Requests
Pull requests are welcome! This project uses [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for PR titles. Please follow this format when making changes. Some examples include:

- `feat: added new feature`
- `fix(cli): corrected typo in help message`
- `docs: updated README.md`

Descriptions are useful for me to understand the changes.

Following this format ensures your changes can be automatically versioned and released in a timely manner. If you're unsure, I can help you with this process.
